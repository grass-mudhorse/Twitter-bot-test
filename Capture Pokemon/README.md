It will generate a sentence like “Grace Murray Hopper met but couldn't catch a female Granny Smith Apple Lapras today.” The funny point for this bot is that the figures, who people are familiar with, are trying to catch a Pokemon with a strange color. For example, we can probably see Albert Einstein or Emma Watson caught a Pokemon with Granny Smith Apple color, and the capture rate is 50%. 

The code for this bot is automatically generated by Twinecery. It is easier to use Twinecery to import the data from Corpora because some data like color and Pokemon have several different properties. It could be harder to import them by manually copying and pasting. Additionally, Twinecery can export code for Tracery grammar. It is an effective tool to develop this bot.
